# FilterGuiDemo
This plugin is an example of a simple filter frequency response display. 
The filter response GUI component is drawn using JUCE path's and is an evaluation of the filters transfer function. 

The code is basic and could do with some improvements. At present the filter in this plugin is a simple one pole 
virtual analogue filter so as to make the code dealing with the drawing of the filter response path as simple as 
possible to understand. 

Future revisions of this example plugin will implement further filter types and response shapes along with oversampling
and some other goodies. 

Feel free to make any suggestions to this repo/code, I am hoping this plugin will be useful for JUCE newbies and give a 
starting point for a handy GUI class for others. I will gradually attempt to make the filter response GUI component/class more
reusable and generic for inclusion into people's projects.
